# ASD Conversation Classification

This project focuses on building an NLP-based classification pipeline to distinguish between conversations involving children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and those involving neurotypical individuals. The conversations are drawn from natural, unstructured social interactions.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- To identify linguistic characteristics in ASD children's speech using text classification techniques.
- To benchmark traditional ML models against transformer-based approaches (IndoBERT).
- To gain interpretable insights into ASD-related language patterns that could assist early research-driven screening.

## 🧪 Research Pipeline

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyze sentence length, token frequency, and speaker patterns.

2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Normalize informal terms (e.g., "nggak", "iyeee")
   - Stem using Sastrawi
   - Remove stopwords (combined from NLTK, Sastrawi, and custom set)

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - TF-IDF (traditional baseline)
   - IndoBERT embeddings (fine-tuned transformer)

4. **Modeling**
   - Baseline: Logistic Regression and SVM
   - Training with Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation

5. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Outputs: Confusion Matrix and classification reports

6. **Interpretability (Planned)**
   - Use LIME or SHAP to reveal influential words/features
   - Explore attention heatmaps from BERT

7. **Early Fusion (Planned)**
   - Combine textual features with handcrafted linguistic/behavioral features

## 🧠 Input and Output

- **Input:** Transcription text from ASD or NON-ASD participants
- **Output:** Binary label prediction: `ASD` or `NON-ASD`
- **Main model:** IndoBERT (fine-tuned on labeled conversations)

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Ethical Considerations

- This model is strictly for research purposes; **it is not a diagnostic tool**.
- All conversational data must be anonymized and ethically approved for use.
- The model may reflect dataset bias (e.g., regional language variants) and must be validated by domain experts before any clinical use.
